👋 Hi, I’m @connoralydon

I work at Wiliot as a Software Engineer on the Data Products & Algorithms team. Wiliot enables firms to quantify information about their physical products and gather useful insights about them. I am a 2022 graduate of Chapman University with degrees in Data Science and Economics. I previously worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Toyota Racing Development where I built an application to save $10,000 a year annually on labor costs. Outside of work I like learning the newest technologies in cloud and data science as well as exploring the great outdoors. I strive to learn every day and build products that provide tangible value.

🌱 I’m currently learning flask and distributed systems.
